# Branch: basic-functionality-done

This branch contains all the steps for creating a basic non scalable app.
In the next few branched I'll use `contextApi` and stuff to serve just parts of state to applications rather than serving the whole thing.

This part includes [#](Learn.md/)
- Making a collection
- CRUD
- Authentication via Google and email | everything else follows same pattern.
