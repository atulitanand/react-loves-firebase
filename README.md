# React and FireBase Fullstack blog app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Summary of project
I undertook and developed a Project - a React and Firebase blog application. This project represents a significant milestone in my journey as a developer, where I applied my skills to leverage modern technologies for real-world application.

Using React and Firebase, I meticulously crafted a fully functional blog app from scratch. The utilization of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowed for the creation of a dynamic and responsive user experience. Firebase, a comprehensive platform for building mobile and web applications, provided powerful backend services such as authentication, real-time database, and hosting, enabling seamless integration and efficient data management.

One of the key highlights of this project is the implementation of a robust login system. Through Firebase authentication, users can securely log in and access personalized features, ensuring a smooth and secure user experience. Additionally, the project incorporates a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system for articles, allowing users to create, view, edit, and delete blog posts with ease.

This project not only demonstrates my technical proficiency in utilizing modern web development technologies but also showcases my ability to conceptualize, design, and implement a full-fledged application. It underscores my commitment to continuous learning and innovation in the ever-evolving field of software development.

** Available Scripts **

In the project directory, you can run:

 `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

 `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

 `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

 `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
